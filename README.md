Repository about Bubble Charts and their usage

A bubble chart is a type of chart that displays three dimensions of data. Each entity with its triplet of associated data is plotted as a disk that expresses two of the vᵢ values through the disk's xy location and the third through its size.

Bubble Charts resemble XY Scatter Charts - but can convey information regarding a third data element per observation, using the size of each traditional XY plotted point (expressed as a “bubble” instead of as a “dot”) to express the magnitude of the third variable.
